This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

1.	I don’t dislike any specific technology as far as it fulfils its purposes. For example, python is good for data analytics/machine learning due to its well-developed pandas and keras library. At the same time java is good in terms of server side. Java has really good thread handling abstract apis like CompletableFuture which allows to handle asynchronous task effectively. 
I prefer to write in Java then in python. However, python has its purpose

2.	I assume that we are talking about software programs. In my opinion good software is robust, fault-tolerant and has high-availability. In addition, it should be agile so that it is easy to integrate it with third party libraries and quickly develop mvp. Hence, it should be well-written – e.g., no boilerplate code. If talking about java then functional interface which were introduced in java 8 allowed developers to avoid a lot of boilerplate code

3.	My last interesting challenged involved designing personalized upsell algorithms for customers based on the products that they bought. I had to work with several part of the stack as I was in charge both front-end and backend aspect of this algorithm. For example, I had to design models in python, store trained models in database and use java to quickly retrieve them from db. In addition, I needed to integrate it in our mobile apps (IOS, Android) for smooth user experience.

I could overcome this challenge by reading lots of interesting machine learning/java literature out of job hours which I have enjoyed. Also, by asking question in the team

4.	In my next role I am looking for opportunity for growth as software backend engineer. Precisely, I want to be a better java engineer

5.	Right now, I am interested more in code side of software development, but I always try to understand what is the business purposes of code lines which I write. It gives better understanding of the process and more space for solution. Hence, software that I write should bring value to the company – e.g., greater revenue or less capital/operational expenses
